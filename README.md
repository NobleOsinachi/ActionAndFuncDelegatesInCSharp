# Action and Func Delegates in C#

This repository contains examples and explanations of Action and Func delegates in C#. Action and Func are two commonly used delegate types in C# that allow you to work with methods as if they were data. This can be particularly useful when working with functional programming concepts or passing methods as parameters to other methods.

## Introduction

In C#, delegates are used to reference methods, which allows you to pass methods as parameters, return methods from other methods, and create dynamic method calls. Two frequently used delegate types are Action and Func.

- **Action**: Action is a delegate type that represents a method that takes zero or more input parameters but does not return a value. It is often used for methods that perform actions, such as printing to the console or updating a database.

- **Func**: Func is a delegate type that represents a method that takes zero or more input parameters and returns a value. It is used for methods that perform calculations and return results.

This repository provides examples of how to use Action and Func delegates in various scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NobleOsinachi/ActionAndFuncDelegatesInCSharp.git
```

You can then explore the examples in the provided code files and run them to see how Action and Func delegates work in different situations.

## Examples

The repository includes several code examples demonstrating the usage of Action and Func delegates. Here are some of the examples you can find:

1. **Example 1**: Basic usage of Action and Func delegates.
2. **Example 2**: Using Action to perform actions with different parameter types.
3. **Example 3**: Using Func to perform calculations and return results.
4. **Example 4**: Combining Action and Func delegates for more complex scenarios.

Each example is accompanied by comments and explanations in the code to help you understand how the delegates are used.
